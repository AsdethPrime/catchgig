Introduction 
-------------

A friend of mine gave me a rather nice idea. A concept similar to seek but individualised for individual sector. The core technology will first works as a web app; provided that is once created I will try and create mobile and desktop version of it. 

Tech Stack 
----------
Though this is subject to change , I will be using the following stack:
1) Frontend => Angular 
2) Backend => NestJs
3) ORM => TypeORM
4) Database => MongoDB

So more or less a normal MEAN stack with a bit of TypeScript twist. 

Routes
-------
1) Homepage 
2) Employeer 
3) Employee 
4) Profile 
5) Register
